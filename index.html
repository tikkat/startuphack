And we're as excited as ever to arrange this years <strong>Gothenburg Startup Hack</strong> as a part of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gbgtechweek&src=typd" title="#gbgtechweek"><i class="icon-hashtag"></i><span>gbgtechweek</span></a>. It is our little <strong>darling</strong>. Our grand <strong>flagship</strong>. This site will serve as the deck where you can find most of the information regarding <strong>the hack</strong>. Feel free to look around. Mayhaps send us one of those <a href="mailto:info@gbgstartuphack.com"><span>emails</span></a> if there's anything on your mind.</p>
      <p>The signup will open <strong>April 20</strong> and the Hack itself will take place <strong>May 16</strong>. We will also be hosting <strong>the Meetup</strong> where you can find people to team up with, share <strong>ideas</strong> and find <strong>inspiration</strong>.</p>

      <h1>Practical Info</h1>

      <p>Gothenburg Startup Hack is about <strong>building and demoing a product prototype</strong>.

      <p>We prefer <strong>fresh ideas</strong> and <strong>technological innovation</strong> over a solid business case. Don't worry about the numbers or the bottom line — use your imagination, think outside the box and go nuts!

      <p><strong>This hack is about building stuff</strong> — a demo with just a PowerPoint presentation ain't gonna fly.

      <p>We are hosting a <strong>meetup on April 27</strong> — where we all hang out and meet each other. Looking for a team or more team members? This is the right place to be!

      <p>Once you have put together a versatile team, make sure to sign up before the application deadline — <strong><time datetime="2015-05-2">May 2</time></strong>.

      <p>We think that the best teams are made up of people with <strong>different skills</strong> and <strong>different backgrounds</strong>.

      <p>We recommend team sizes <strong>between 3 to 5 people</strong>.

      <p>Finally, the hack takes place on <strong>May 16</strong>. Be prepared to hack from early in the morning 'til late in the evening.

      <p>We will keep you comfortable and make sure you are fed all the way through.</p>

        You and your team have exactly one day to turn your product idea into a working prototype.

        Use your time wisely — at the end of the day you will take the stage to demo what you have built.

        The day starts when you enter the Vault. We will show you to your seats and help you get set up — the goal is to get up and running with the hacking.

        During lunch, we will all take a break and eat together — a good opportunity to meet with other hackers and share ideas.

        We will keep hacking until sunset — this is when we start the demos. Be sure to pay attention and remember your favorite teams — the winning team will be decided through majority vote.

        Oh, and by the way. The day ends with a huge-ass party!

        <p>We're <strong>proud</strong> to present this year's location. A location <i>Poseidon</i> himself would approve. We're on a boat. The <strong>S:t Erik</strong>. This means that you can all fulfill your dreams to become seamen!</p>
        <p>Since we know all true hackers loves the sea, we have rented the most prestigious ship. From 9 to 14 we will be crusing the archipelago of the lovely city <strong>Gothenburg</strong> in our ship.</p>
        <p>We will then return to shore and keep the ship stationary in order to tend to the landlubbers needs and batten down the hatches.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Can I sign up alone?</h3>
          <p>Sorry, but no. A hackathon is about building cool things together. But why not bring your idea and find your team at <strong>the Meetup</strong>?</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How large can our team be?</h3>
          <p>At most 5 people, and you should be at least 2.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Where do I find team members?</h3>
          <p>IRL, at the internet, or at <strong>the Meetup</strong>. Try using our hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gbgstartuphack&src=typd">#gbgstartuphack</a> when looking for prospective team members!</p>
        </div>
        <div>

          <p>Nope. Just make sure you sign up before May 2th.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>My idea and/or team has somehow changed since we entered our signup information, what do I do?</h3>

          <h3>Can we start hacking on our idea before the hack?</h3>
          <p>Please use common sense; do not bring your startup’s finished product/prototype. Use this day to hack on the things you do not normally get time for.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>There’s no Facebook event for The Hack? Where and how do I sign up?</h3>
          <p><a href="#sign-up">Here.</a></p>

          <h3>Does the idea/prototype have to be strictly based on IT?</h3>
          <p>This is a hackathon, so it should include hacking code in one way or the other. If you’re unsure if your idea fits the format, just <a href="mailto:info@gbgstartuphack.com">drop us a mail.</a></p>

          <h3>Do I need to be able to code in order to apply?</h3>
          <p>Oh no! It's all about building a team which eventually will deliver something cool during the day.
          Feel free to be the planning person in your group.</p>
          <h4>A sample team</h4>
          <p>A neat team compilation of four people consist of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Two developers</li>
            <li>One designer</li>
            <li>One <em>planning person</em> overseeing the progress, creating the presentation, engineering the
            overall vision, and more.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Or, why separate the roles?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Three developers knowing design, or three designers who can code</li>
            <li>One <em>planning person</em></li>
          </ul>
